                This site is more of a project than a blog. I created it to
                experiment with web development technologies and showcase my
                skills as a developer.

                While the content reflects my interest in plants, cooking, and
                other topics I find intriguing, the focus is on trying out ideas
                and testing techniques rather than maintaining a traditional
                blog.
